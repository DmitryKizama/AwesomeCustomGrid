# AwesomeCustomGrid<br>

This is Demo app I created to train myself implement custom views from redlines (PSD - I had found this screens on internet, there are part of social network)<br>
<br>
Functionality : <br>
You can switch layouts - swipe layout or grid. You can click on grid girls, and they go to the top, and click to Top bar, and they go to the bottom, simple. The same with swipe - swipe right to add girl to the Top, and press on top bar girl, to take her back to the swipe layout.<br>
<br>
